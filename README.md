## Hannah Desmond
I am a determined, adaptable and warm full-stack junior developer. I come bearing plenty of transferable skills gained from a solid academic and practical background in psychology as well as experience teaching English abroad and coaching tech professionals in communication. For the last several years, I have also worked as a freelance proofreader and copywriter. As well as my fresh-to-the-market tech skills, I bring creativity, top-notch communication skills and an inquisitive nature to my work. And if you ask my former colleagues, they'd tell you I'm fun to work with. 

In January 2021, I joined selective bootcamp, Makers Academy, marking the most exciting step in my career journey so far. I'm a ardent learner and I am excited to find a role where I can do something positive while continuing to expand my knowledge and skills that I acquired at Makers and during my previous work experience.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Communication Skills

I am an articulate communicator with notable written, oral, influencing, presentation and active listening skills. I have built on these skills throughout my career, starting in customer service and adminstrative teams. My skills grew, enabling me to become more persuasive and precise in my communication when coaching behaviour change and motivating patients and students in my mental health and welfare roles, as well as working with external teams and services with conflicting priorities, persuading them to take action, and having difficult conversations with colleagues, students and patients. 

More recently, in my capacity as freelance copywriter, I improved the web presence, visibility and credibility of a client (a social enterprise) by delivering weby copy for a large website. I interviewed the MD and their staff, as well as other stakeholders such as artists and volunteers, to create a comprehensive brief. I communicated remotely with the web designer to understand the templates that I needed to work within, as well as communicate the requirements from a copy perspective. Over a period of 2 months I wrote, sought feedback and revised the web copy, which you can find here: https://ourbigpicture.co.uk

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing comedy – mostly sketches. I have dabbled behind the stand-up comedy mic too, which is as scary as it sounds, but also very fun. 

I also love fiddling about with electronic music and I've DJed at various events.
